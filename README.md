## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

Here are the things I have learned working on this project:

- **React Router DOM**
- **Framer Motion**

In React Router DOM I learned how to create multiple page website and any additional routes inside each page.

And in Framer Motion I learned how to add Animations for Page transitions or when component re-render and Animations for any element in the page.

### Continued development

I want to Learn more about Framer Motion in React because I liked how simple it is to use and also can be very useful to create complex animation if used very well I want to start bt watching [this playlist by The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iHDnQfTHEVVceOEBsOf07i) and maybe diving more into their documentation [Framer Motion Docs](https://www.framer.com/docs/). further more there is a lot of interesting tutorials on Youtube to create amazing filtering animations, smooth transitions and more that I will take in consideration when building my next project.
